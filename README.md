# Streaming-Availability

## About the App
This app is a place where you can search a movie or tv show you want to see and it will show you which streaming services has those movies and T.V shows. It will let you know the price of the streaming service in a monthly subscription. Furthermore, if you add more than 1 movie, lets just say 5 movies, it will show the streaming service that has the most amount of movies, and give you the best value for it, so you save more money.

I would also add a small theme behind it, like Tom and Jerry charcters instead of a simple X and O, or like some colours to make it more colourful and pretty.
